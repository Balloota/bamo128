#summary bamo128 as arduino bootloader.
in preparation<br>
=== behavior of arduino boards and arduino bootloader===
You can reset arduino boards per software from pc over the serial USB-cable.<br>
The software activates the DTR control line of serial port and a capacitor at the board produce an reset impuls.<br>
The arduino integrated development environment (IDE) and avrdude (with the programmer option -carduino) use this software reset for bootloading.<br>
The bootloader shipped with the arduino board waits after reset about 1/2 second for characters from serial USB-port.<br>
If it no chars received, it starts the application program at address 0 (if there is such program).<br>
If chars were received, the bootloader checks the chars.<br>
If the chars are control sequences of the stk500V1 uploading protocol, uploading software is started. The Arduino-IDE and avrdude send this sequences for uploading.
Within the 1/2 second after reset you can send some '!' chars from a terminal and the bootloader switches to the simple monitor integrated in some arduino bootloaders.<br>
I hope this description is correct!!<br>
===Bamo128 as arduino bootloader===
Bamo128 uploads software and data with the stk500V1 protocol.<br>
After reset it waits about 1/2 second for chars from serial USB port.<br>
If it received such, it jumps to the uploading code and bamo128 (how the arduino boards) upload software.<br>
In the other case (no chars received), it jumps to the monitor and waits endlessly for bamo128 monitor commands.<br>
The main difference is, that arduino boards start applications if no chars were received after reset, but bamo128 jumps to the monitor.<br>
You must start the application with the monitor command:<br>
#> g 0<br>
explicitely.<br>
Feel free to change this behavior in the open bamo128 software.<br>
