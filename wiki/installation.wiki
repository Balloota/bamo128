=== software requirements===
in preparation<br>
Install the GNU toolchain (avr-gcc,...) for avr8 microcontroller under linux. The latest tools are hidden in avr32studio http://www.atmel.no/beta_ware currently.
If you download and unpack avr32studio in the /opt/cross dir, your environment is compatible with the bamo128 paths.<br>
Unpack bamo128xx.tar.gz. Connect your board with a programmer and the programmer and the board via USB with our pc.<br>
We use the programmer avrISPmkII for arduino boards, for other programmers change the Makefile in the bamo128 directory<br>.
The Makefile contains goals for burning the monitor in the board CharonII (atmega128 and externtal 32KRAM), arduino Mega (atmega1280) and arduino Duemilanove (atmega328).<br>
Adapt the Makefile for other boards.
