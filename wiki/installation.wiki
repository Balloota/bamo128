#summary howto install bamo128
=== software requirements===
in preparation<br>
Install the GNU toolchain (avr-gcc,...) for avr8 microcontroller under linux and avrdude for monitor uploading. The latest GNU tools are hidden in avr32studio http://www.atmel.no/beta_ware currently.
If you download and unpack avr32studio in the /opt/cross dir, your environment is compatible with the bamo128 paths.<br>
Unpack bamo128xx.tar.gz. Connect your board with a programmer and the programmer and the board via USB with our pc.<br>
We use the programmer avrISPmkII for arduino boards, for other programmers change the Makefile in the bamo128 directory<br>.
=== bamo128 at atmega processors ===
Bamo128 needs 4Kword (a 16 bit) flash program memory space preferabely in the bootsection of controller (at least the routine Do_spm in file flash.asm) and 256 Byte sram (the best place for sram memory is at INTERNAL_SRAM_END for boards without external ram).<br>
In the standard installation starts bamo128 after reset in the bootsection, where the monitor is placed. The interrupt vector table is at the beginning of flash memory (address 0).<br>
Bamo128 works with interrupt (timer2 for the step and break command, timer1 for the currentTimeMilliSec variable) and burns 2 entries in the vector table.
=== installation for arduino boards ===
The Makefile contains goals for burning the monitor in the board CharonII (atmega128 and externtal 32KRAM), arduino Mega (atmega1280) and arduino Duemilanove (atmega328).<br>
=== cooperation of bamo128 with applications === 
With bamo128 you can upload application<br>
=== 
Adapt the Makefile for other boards.
