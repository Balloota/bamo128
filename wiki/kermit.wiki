#summary communication with bamo128 over kermit
You can use kermit, the known terminal interaction and file transfer program, to  communicate with bamo128 (without data/program uploading).<br>
Save an initialization file in your home dir:<br>
{{{
; Line properties
set modem type             none ; Direct connection
set line           /dev/ttyUSB0 ; Device file
set speed                 57600 ; Line speed
set carrier-watch           off ; No carrier expected
set handshake              none ; No handshaking
set flow-control           none ; No flow control

; Communication properties
robust                          ; Most robust transfer settings macro
set receive packet-length  1000 ; Max pack len remote system should use
set send packet-length     1000 ; Max pack len local system should use
set window                   10 ; Nbr of packets to send until ack

; File transfer properties
set file type            binary ; All files transferred are binary
set file names          literal ; Don't modify filenames during xfers


Connect your arduino via USB with the pc and start kermit in a terminal window:<br>

#> kermit -c
